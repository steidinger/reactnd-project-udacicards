# Udacity Project UdaciCards

This project contains the code for the Udacity project *UdaciCards*. It is a mobile app implemented with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

The app allows a user to manage a collections of virtual "flashcards" and use them to study. Flashcards are organized in "decks". Each deck can contain an arbitrary number of cards and each card contains a question and an answer. The user can add decks to the collection and cards to a deck. Currently there is no way to edit or delete either decks or cards.
